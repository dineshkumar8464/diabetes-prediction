# Diabetes Prediction | Streamlit Interface

Welcome to the repository for the **Diabetes Prediction Web App**, developed as part of my skill building.  
*A project focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning models and an interactive Streamlit interface.*

---

## Overview

**Diabetes Prediction** is a user-friendly web application that utilizes Machine Learning techniques to estimate whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health parameters.

It supports:

* Real-time health-based prediction
* Interactive and clean UI
* Scalable and responsive deployment

To design and implement this tool:

* Accurately predicts diabetes risk using trained ML models (e.g., Random Forest, KNN)
* Helps users and healthcare teams make data-driven health decisions
* Provides a smooth user experience through an intuitive interface

## Repository Contents

The repository structure is as follows:
 - `.gitignore` – Specifies files/folders Git should ignore (e.g., `venv/`, `.idea/`, `__pycache__/`).
 - `README.md` – Provides an overview, setup guide, and usage instructions for the project.
 - `app.py` – Main streamlit scripts that develops the web application UI for making predictions easily.  
 - `diabetes.csv` – Dataset containing patient health information used to train the model.
 - `main.py` – Main Python script that implements diabetes prediction using machine learning models.
